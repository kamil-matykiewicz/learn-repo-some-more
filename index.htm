    <h2>End Rhyme</h2>
    <p>The following passage demonstrate end rhyme, which occurs at the end of two or more lines.</p>
    <p>Full fathom five thy father lies;<br>
    Of his bones are coral made;<br>
    Those are pearls that were his eyes;<br>
    Nothing of him that does fade,<br>
    But doth suffer a sea-change <br>
    Into something rich and strange. <a href="http://www.shakespearestudyguide.com/Tempest.html">(The Tempest, 1.2.456)</a>
